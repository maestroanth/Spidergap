ReadMe For _Spidergap_Question_2.js and _Spidergap_Question_2_Tests.js
Author: Anthony Walter
Date: 9/14/2017 

Instructions: 

1. Make sure node.js is installed (node -v to see version number)

2. In terminal, navigate to the folder where this file is located

3. Run the command "node _Spidergap_Question_2.js"

4. The terminal will output the names and addresses of all companies within 100km unless 
showAll is set to true. Otherwise, terminal will output all companies plus the # of offices and distances.

5. The distanceFromLondon variable can be changed to change the distance from London to something other
than 100 km. However, make sure showAll is set to false or it will still just output all companies

6. Do NOT go to localhost:8080. All output will be through the console.

To Run Tests:

1. Make sure node.js is installed

2. In terminal, navigate to the folder where this file is located

3. Run the command "node _Spidergap_Question_2_Tests.js" 

4. All unit tests should run in console.

**Author Note: I did contemplate the option of prompting the user first to initialize the showAll 
and distanceFromLondon variables which I would probably do in real-life, but I decided against it 
since it wasn't necessarily part of the scope requirement. This at least outputs the assignment
instructions exactly as indicated on the default settings.**
