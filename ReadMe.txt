Preface:
There are two questions each in it's own folder. The first question addresses the
issue of deep vs. shallow object cloning.  The second question does great circle calculations
to find arclengths in km to different latitude and longitude points from Central London.
  
Each folder has it's own individual instructions to run the programs and supplemental tests.
